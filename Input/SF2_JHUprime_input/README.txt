This data is released as supplementary material to the article submitted for consideration by the Solar Energy Advances journal.
Please note that the file we release ('118_CAISO_FESTIV_SEA.xlsx') includes data for the system and the names of the files that include
timeseries data. 


In detail, tabs 'DA_LOAD_REF','DA_VG_REF','DA_RESERVE_REF','RTC_VG_REF','RTC_LOAD_REF','RTD_VG_REF','RTD_LOAD_REF','ACTUAL_VG_REF','ACTUAL_LOAD_REF'
include the name of timeseries files. Due to non disclosure agreements, we can not release all the timeseries files. We use "red" in the input file for 
tabs that include references to files with proprietary data. We use "orange" for tabs that we have included a subset of files in the 
Timeseries subfolder of this case  for one day.
