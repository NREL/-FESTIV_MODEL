%User can enter a functional mod here which can automatically be read by
%FESTIV, by going to FESTIV_ADDL_OPTIONS, and changing either 
% RTSCUCSTART_MODE_RTC or RTSCUCSTART_MODE_RPU to a value of anything but 1 or 2. 
% For example, make it 3 if the code is fairly simple, or you can use RTSCUCSTART_MODE_RTC=3 and
% RTSCUCSTART_MODE_RPU=4 if you want to change both options in which case, you would have to refer to both here.
% Please see RTSCUCSTART code for assistance.
