Q_MIN_DOWN_TIME2(GEN,INTERVAL) MIN DOWN TIME CONSTRAINT FOR ENDING INTERVALS
Q_COMMITMENT_HARD_HI(GEN,INTERVAL) USED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT ENFORCING COMMITMENT ON BY INTERVAL
Q_COMMITMENT_HARD_LO(GEN,INTERVAL) USED FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT ENFORCING COMMITMENT OFF BY INTERVAL
Q_STARTUP(GEN,INTERVAL) TO DETERMINE STARTUP SHUTDOWN VARIABLES
Q_STARTUP2(GEN,INTERVAL) TO DETERMINE STARTUP SHUTDOWN VARIABLES FOR INTERVAL 0
Q_STARTUP3(GEN,INTERVAL) MAKE SURE CANNOT SU AND SD SIMULATANEOUSLY. COSTS WILL USUALLY DRIVE THESE DOWN IF THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY ANYWAY
